# Session Notes - 2022-04-30

* Arrived at [[Sutek the Storm King]]'s castle while he was under the guise of Lord Cassian
* Gave a monologue after revealing several things:
  * Has a lich nemesis named [[Hara]]
  * Fell in love with her and turned into a human
  * He offered her treasure if she decided to accept him in his dragon form
  * She accepted but took shit and ran, escaping through a portal to [[Ahn’Qiraj]]
  * Turned the town against [[Sutek the Storm King]]
  * Tried to use a device to destroy Sutek's castle which would crash down on [[Ka Amena]] if he did nothing
  * Fought back against the people of [[Ahn’Qiraj]] but accidentally ignited black powder that [[Hara]] set which ended up destroying the city
  * He later was attacked by [[Arridax]] who had become [[Hara]]'s thrall
  * Ended up using the [[Horn of Asgaroth]] to summon [[Sune]] who scared [[Hara]] off
* Told us about [[Hara]]'s plot to place an **Orb of the Undead** under [[Ka Amena]]
