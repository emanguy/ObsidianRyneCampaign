  * **I have disadvantage on perception checks since I have no eye protection**
  * **I take 1d4 slashing at the beginning of every turn due to the sandstorm**
* [[Hara]] is diving at random people throughout the sandstorm
* [[Talosshard]] gives me the ability to jump between ligtning bolts without needing to make a check
* I snatched defeat from the jaws of victory as I made Hara drop her sandstorm ring and then she conked me the fuck out
* Shit I saw as I hurtled through the multiverse
  * Black tower being constructed in Avernus
  * Great celestial clock in Mechanum
  * Star exploding in the Astral Plane
* We learned through [[Orluna]]'s vision that [[The Lich King]] is building something to revive [[Vecna]]
* There are multiple paths through the [[Valley of Corrupted Gravity]]
