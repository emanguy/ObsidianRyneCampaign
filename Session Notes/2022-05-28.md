# Session Notes - 2022-05-28

* [[Caden]]'s talisman gives him command over a demon who he encountered for the first time in a dream
* Got visited in the morning by [[Lord Turell]]
  * Wants to pay us with a secret route to the [[Duergar Keep]]
* Made our way down to the crypts, there's a plaque that says we shouldn't raid the tombs or the dead will come for us
  * I have a thought that there might be dragons buried in the crypt
