* If character sees blood during a fight, they must make a constitution saving throw or become paralyzed during their next turn.
* The DC for the saving throw starts at `11 + 1d4` and each successive blood sighting increases the DC by 2
* After the character is afflicted by paralysis, they will not be affected again for the remainder of combat
