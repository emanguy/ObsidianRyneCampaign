# Hara's Crown

_Can be activated once per day_

Lasts for a number of turns equal to your proficiency bonus. When active, whenever a creature deals damage to you it also takes that damage.

_Passive effect_ - If damage reduces you to 0 HP, **unless the damage taken is from a crit or radiant damage** you can roll a constitution saving throw with a DC of `5 + damage taken`. On success, you are instead reduced to 1 hitpoint.
